Which is the semantic HTML element to define important text?

???
???

* <strong>
* important, i, b


---
## Revision

By default, both b and strong display the same within web browsers, but the difference is <strong> has semantic meaning and <b> is just a visual effect.

???

The default style of both b and strong is font-weight: strong;

???
* T
* F (bold)
