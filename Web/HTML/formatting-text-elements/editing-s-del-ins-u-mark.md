## Revision

Avoid using the <u> element where it can be confused with links.

???

It is best to use <ins> together with <del> to properly showcase updates to a document.

???

The <s> element that defined strikethrough text was deprecated in HTML 4.01, but redefined in HTML5 as text that is no longer correct.

???

The <del> tag defines elements that is being delayed during the start of an animation.

???

The <s> and <del> elements visually appear the same by default, but have different semantic meaning.

* F (text that has been deleted from a document)
